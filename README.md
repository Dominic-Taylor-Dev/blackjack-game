# blackjack-game - testing okay to push

This is a very simple, one-file game, intended to be played from the command line. It already contains the "run_game" instruction (which is a loop method), so simply launching the game from the command line should work.

Of course, you'll need Ruby installed for this to work. If you have that, you should be able to:

1. Navigate to the containing forlder via your terminal e.g. ~/projects/blackjack-game
2. Launch the file by typing $ruby blackjack-game
