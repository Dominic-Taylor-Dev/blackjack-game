<h1>Blackjack Game</h1>

<h2> How to Use</h2>
This is a very simple, one-file game, intended to be played from the command line. It already contains the "run_game" instruction (which is a loop method) inside the code, so simply launching the game file from the command line should kick you off. The steps to get it running are:
  
  1. Download the blackjack.rb file to your computer.
  2. Launch terminal.
  3. Make sure you have Ruby installed (you can check this with <code>$ ruby -v</code>).
  4. Navigate to the folder containing blackjack.rb via your terminal.
  5. Launch the file by typing $ruby blackjack.rb
